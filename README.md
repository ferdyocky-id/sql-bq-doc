# SQL Language Documentation

## ðŸ˜º Overview

Back then, I was thinking there's no point in documenting my work process since I was the only one who knew it, also kind of lazy. However, as the company grows, people also grow. I kinda feel the need to document the process not only for myself, but for the company and people within.  

I do data modeling twice for two different presentation areas: 
1. Dashboard and visualization in Power BI
2. Tabular view in Google Sheets

Why? Because I cater to stakeholders' needs. For a quick snapshot, upper stakeholders prefer dashboard. For more actionable from insight given, tabular because they can easily copy-paste to Excel spreadsheet.
